# Deep Research (Multi-Agent System)
- Deep Research Agentic System built with OpenAI Agents SDK.
- Consists of 4 agents namely planner_agent, search_agent, writer_agent, evaluator_agent.
- Planner Agent comes up with terms to search given a query to research on.
- Searcher Agent equipped with OpenAI's WebSearchTool to search the web using the search terms generated by planner agent (Max 5 searches) and generates a short summary.
- Writer Agent takes the short summary generated by searcher agent and writes a detailed report on the topic.
- The report is then passed to the evaluator agent. It runs evaluation on the report, produces an evaluation summary and gives a final judgement of whether to accept or reject the report, if the report is rejected, the workflow runs again with writer agent being executed again.
- The Gradio app displays the result in clean Markdown.
